# Algorithms-and-Data-Structure  
Here is the list of all algorithms, seperated into a few categories, according to the course of Stanford on coursera - Algorithms Specialization.

## Part1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

### 1.1 Asymptotic Analysis  
- Recursive Algorithm for multiplication of two integers  
- Karatsube Algorithm for multiplication of two integers  
- Merge Sort  

### 1.2 Devide & Conquer Algorithms, the Master Method  
- Devidde and Conquer counting inversions  

### 1.3 Quick Sort Algorithm  
- Quick Sort (first element as pivot)  
- Quick Sort (last element as pivot)  
- Quick Sort (median of three numbers as pivot)  
- Quick Sort (random pivot)  

### 1.4 Linear-time Selection, Graphs, the Contraction Algorithm  
- Karger Min Cut Algorithm  

## Part2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

### 2.1 BFS and DFS
- Computing SCCs (Strongly Connected Components) using Iteration
- Computing SCCs using Recursion (this version works not well on a large data set)

### 2.2 Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (using brute-force)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (using heap)
